**Questions for Applicants Answer**

1. How many hours did you spend on the challenge?  
A: Around 5.5 hours in total. I had init the repository last week, but had other commitments during weekend studies that I had worked on starting Monday afternoon.  

2. What improvements or enhancements would you implement if you had more time?
A: More proper type checking (even I didn't init the project as typescript and changed it later on). Might be better for maintainability in the future. Likewise, I would also want to add a filtering feature since there is enough data given within the API to do so.  

3. Which parts of your work are you most proud of? Please explain.
A: The infinite scrolling part. It is definitely something I have never done on an actual project before. Hence, I had to learn something on the fly.  

4. Which parts of the challenge do you spend the most time on? What did you find most  
difficult? Please explain.  
A: Once again, the infinite scrolling part. I spent a good 2 hours trying to figure out how not to have it conflict with the state of the button alone.  

5. Did you use any libraries for the challenge? What are they used for? Why did you  
choose these libraries and not the alternatives?
A: I chose Tailwind for the framework only to realize I forgot a lot of the syntax and had to open the documentation for every tiny step. I wanted to try out more server side optimization Next offers, but found it just easier to use client-side's React states. Therefore, performance could be improved.  

6. What do you think of the challenge overall?
A: There were new and forgotten things to be relearned in a short amount of time. I believe this challenge helps put me in a good shape on what to expect in a real position.  

7. How can we improve the challenge? We would love to hear them.  
A: I believe the figma design is very vague, and that's maybe to leave us with a little more freedom of design. I had to eyeball for pixel perfect (since we couldn't even check for separation paddings), but I think I was close enough using 4px grid rule.  

8. Any other thoughts that you wish to share with us?
A: Honestly, I think I've submitted this challenge later than I am able to. Despite the commit logs showing I can achieve the task quickly, I hope to get started on it sooner when not studying and doing full-time work.
